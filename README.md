# TicTacToeGame

## Overview

It is a classic game for two players, X and O, that alternates to determine distances in a 3 x 3 grid.
The player who passes three of his marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

This project is to implement the game in web/mobile application using the technology,
that I have been practicing on during the past two weeks to use my programming skills of the logic for the game.
